    * compiled - C, C++, Go, Haskell
    * why/not compile
        * slow
        * interpreted: but libraries 1.234 vs 1.237
        * Go still has problems with libraries, but I can work them out locally
    * go - best of both worlds - compiled and fast to compile
        * possibly multicore/concurrency
        * negatives: can be verbose, primitive
